# Credit Risk Analysis

## Overview
In this project we used Python to build and evaluate several machine learning models to predict credit risk. To do so we used the following methodologies:
- oversample the data using RandomOverSampler and SMOTE
- undersampled the data using ClusterCentroids
- used a combined approach of over and under sampling using SMOTEENN
- compare two machine learning models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier
